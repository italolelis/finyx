<objective>

Research a location for real estate investment, gathering critical data:
- Development details (name, developer, size)
- Erbpacht status (CRITICAL - auto-exclude if undisclosed)
- Public transport quality
- Parking necessity assessment
- Market conditions

**Creates:** `.finyx/research/locations/[location].md`

**After this command:** Run `/finyx:analyze [location]` to calculate metrics.

</objective>

<execution_context>

@~/.claude/finyx/references/disclaimer.md
@~/.claude/finyx/references/erbpacht-detection.md
@~/.claude/finyx/references/transport-assessment.md
@~/.claude/finyx/templates/location-research.md
@.finyx/profile.json

</execution_context>

<process>

## Phase 1: Validation

**Check profile exists:**
```bash
[ -f .finyx/profile.json ] || { echo "ERROR: No financial profile found. Run /finyx:profile first to set up your profile."; exit 1; }
```

**Parse location argument:**
Extract location name from command (e.g., "kassel" from "/finyx:scout kassel")

**Check location folder:**
```bash
[ -d "properties/$LOCATION" ] && echo "EXISTS" || echo "NOT_FOUND"
```

If NOT_FOUND, ask user:
- "Location folder 'properties/[location]' not found. Create it?"
- If yes: `mkdir -p "properties/$LOCATION"`

## Phase 2: Document Discovery

**Scan for existing documents:**
```bash
find "properties/$LOCATION" -type f \( -name "*.pdf" -o -name "*.xlsx" -o -name "*.xls" \) 2>/dev/null
```

Note what's available:
- Price lists (Kaufpreisliste, Preisliste)
- Exposés/brochures
- Calculation examples (Berechnung)
- Floor plans

## Phase 3: Development Research

**Search for development information:**

Web searches:
- "[location] Neubau [current year]"
- "[development name if found in docs] [location]"
- "[developer name if found] [location] project"

**Extract:**
- Development name
- Developer/builder name
- Project size (number of units)
- Address
- Expected completion date
- Project concept (car-free, sustainable, etc.)

## Phase 4: Erbpacht Detection (CRITICAL)

**This is the most important check. Erbpacht with undisclosed costs = EXCLUDE.**

### 4.1 Document Search

Search documents for Erbpacht indicators:
```bash
grep -ri "erbpacht\|erbbaurecht\|erbbauzins" "properties/$LOCATION/" 2>/dev/null
```

### 4.2 Price List Analysis

If Excel price list available, check:
- Grundstücksanteil (land share) percentage
- If land share < 15% → ERBPACHT SUSPECTED

### 4.3 Web Search

Search for Erbpacht mentions:
- "[development name] [location] Erbpacht"
- "[development name] Erbbaurecht"
- "[developer name] ground lease"

### 4.4 Determination

**ERBPACHT STATUS:**
- `✅ NO ERBPACHT DETECTED` - No evidence found, proceed
- `⚠️ ERBPACHT SUSPECTED` - Indicators found, needs verification
- `🚨 ERBPACHT CONFIRMED` - Confirmed, check if costs disclosed

**If CONFIRMED:**
- Search for Erbbauzins (annual ground rent) amount
- Check remaining lease term
- If costs NOT disclosed → **RECOMMEND EXCLUSION**

## Phase 5: Transport Research

**Research public transport quality:**

Web searches:
- "[location] public transport network"
- "[location] tram bus S-Bahn"
- "[development name] location transport"
- "[location] ÖPNV"

**Extract:**
- Nearest public transport stop and distance
- Available lines (tram, bus, S-Bahn)
- Time to city center
- Network quality assessment (EXCELLENT/GOOD/MODERATE/POOR)

## Phase 6: Parking Assessment

**Based on transport quality + development concept:**

**If EXCELLENT transport AND development mentions:**
- "autofrei" (car-free)
- "autoarm" (car-reduced)
- "reduced traffic"
- "walkable"
- Urban location

→ **Parking: VALUABLE BUT NOT ESSENTIAL**

**If MODERATE/POOR transport OR:**
- Suburban location
- Family-oriented development
- Limited public transport

→ **Parking: ESSENTIAL**

## Phase 7: Market Research

**Research local market conditions:**

Web searches:
- "[location] housing market [current year]"
- "[location] Wohnungsmarkt"
- "[location] rental demand"
- "[location] property prices development"

**Extract:**
- Housing deficit/surplus
- Price trend
- Rental demand level
- Major employers/universities nearby

## Phase 8: Write Research File

Create `.finyx/research/locations/[location].md`:

```markdown
