## Phase 0: Pre-flight Check

```bash
[ -f .finyx/profile.json ] || { echo "ERROR: No financial profile found. Run /finyx:profile first to set up your profile."; exit 1; }
```

## Phase 1: Web Research

**Search for current rates:**

Queries:
- "Baufinanzierung Zinsen aktuell [current year]"

**Target sources:**
- Dr. Klein (drklein.de)

## Phase 2: Extract Rate Data

**For each fixed period, extract:**

| Period | Top Rate | Typical Range |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| 5 years | X.XX% | X.XX% - X.XX% |
| 10 years | X.XX% | X.XX% - X.XX% |
| 15 years | X.XX% | X.XX% - X.XX% |
| 20 years | X.XX% | X.XX% - X.XX% |

**Note effective date of data.**

## Phase 3: Compare with Developer Rate

**Load developer rate from analysis:**

- Or from config assumptions

**Calculate difference:**
```
Developer rate:    X.XX%
Market top rate:   X.XX%
Difference:        X.XX%
```

## Phase 4: Calculate Savings

**For each shortlisted unit, calculate:**

```
Loan amount: €[PRICE]
10-year difference at 0.15% lower rate:

Monthly interest savings: Loan × 0.15% ÷ 12
Annual savings: Monthly × 12
10-year savings: Annual × 10 (simplified)
```

## Phase 5: Rate Forecast

**Search for forecasts:**
- "Zinsprognose [current year]"
- "mortgage rate forecast Germany"

**Extract:**
- Expected direction (up/down/stable)
- Expected range
- Key factors (ECB policy, inflation)
